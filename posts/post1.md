Have you ever looked at yourself in the mirror and not liked the look of your skin? Been rejected by a girl lately because you thought your looks weren’t great? Well fear not, because I have some excellent tips to get you looking good again!  
  

  
1. **Buy high quality cleanser.** I cannot stress this enough, cleansing is the most important part of your skincare routine. It removes the dirt and the oil from your skin, and soothes it from everyday wear and tear  


2. **Do not ever touch your face.** Never. Yes, this includes when washing and cleaning.  


3. **Well, you may ask.”well if i am never supposed to touch my face, then how do I clean it properly?”** TLDR, the answer is you just splash your face with a bit of water, and it should get rid of some of that cleanser.    


4. **Speaking of washing your face, never get rid of all your cleanser from your skin after washing.** It is important to have some on you at all times, as it increases the silkiness and softness of your skin, while consistently removing oils and dirt, letting you keep that fresh look all the time  


5. **Exfoliate every single day.** Gets rid of oils and dark spots. Good for your skin  


6. **Showering??? Not that important.** If you don’t have time, prioritize cleansing your face more than your body. People will notice your face a lot more, so even if you smell like curry sometimes, having a good looking, smooth face will more than compensate for it  


7. **Use skin bleach.** Critical if you have very dark skin, as it can help make your skin feel lighter and hence, look smoother and cleaner. However, there is a silver lining, make sure to apply it evenly, otherwise your face will have different shades, and nothing looks more horrendous than one part of your face being black and another white  


8. **Don’t use moisturizer.** It is a waste of money, and if you have been following the above guidelines, the products your using should already leave your skin feeling very moisturized already  


9. **In the summer, sunscreen is not necessary.** If you are using skin bleach like I told you to, you’ll always have pretty light skin to cover up, no matter how tan you get from sun exposure. Skin bleach is the ultimate SPF booster  


10. **Repeat the above nine steps.** Consistently and over time, you’ll notice you have better skin. You can’t expect results only from trying something once or twice, so do it everyday for a few weeks or months.  
  

  

  
That’s it. I hope you realize how I managed to get good looking skin. The next girl I go for will definitely appreciate it, and wish me luck!!
