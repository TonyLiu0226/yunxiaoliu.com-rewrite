**Second year CPEN can be tough.** After all, this is the introduction to one of UBC's hardest programs, where there is bound to be many weeder courses. However, I'll show you some tips and tricks to help you excel, or at the very least suffer much less than I have last year.

1. **The summer before**

- *If you already completed all of your first year courses*

During the summer before your second year, try to get some of the second year courses out of the way. Generally, the list of second year courses is as follows:
- MATH 253
- MATH 220
- CPEN 211
- CPEN 221
- CPEN 281
- CPEN 212
- CPEN 291
- ELEC 201
- CPSC 221
- MATH 256

MATH 253 and 220 are offered in the summer and only has 1st year courses as prerequisites, so you can take those. You should still have plenty of time to chill out even if you take both, as they are offered in different summer terms (253 in May-Jun, 220 in Jul-Aug), so you won't be dealing with more than one course at a time. With these math courses out of the way, you will be able to reduce the load during the winter terms, and therefore reduce your stress levels when the going gets tough.

- *If you haven't finished all of your first year courses*

Finish them, if they are offered in the summer, unless it is your humanities elective (bleh). Then, if you have time left over (ie: you only have 1 course you need to finish from 1st year), see the above section for 2nd year courses you can take. You can take up to 4 courses total in summer, though I would recommend only doing 2-3 if you want to chill.

2. **Course arrangements**

OK u made it, good 4 u. Now the suffering begins. Here are how to arrange your courses based on which scenario you chose from the previous section

- *Scenario 1: 253 and 220 completed*

Congrats. Now you get to suffer less. Here's what I would do:

| T1          | T2          |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| CPEN 211    |  CPSC 221    |
| CPEN 221    |  CPEN 212    |
| \*CPEN 281  |  CPEN 291    |
| MATH 256    |  ELEC 201    |

\* Denotes courses you can move into the following summer.

I suggest doing this because 1st term is brutal. CPEN 211 and 221 alone will take the equivalent amount of time as doing 5 of your 1st year courses combined, no joke. So you definitely don't want to take 5 courses in term 1. Likewise, term 2 isn't that much better, so I prefer moving 256 to t1 with the elec kids so you can chill out a bit then (212 and 202 take a lot of time in that term). However, given how aids 211 and 221 is, perhaps it would be a good idea to drop 281 (it is a useless couse anyways) so you get a couple more hours each week, and take APSC 201 in summer instead.

- *Scenario 2: Only one of the math courses completed, but all 1st year courses completed*

Congrats. You get to suffer less, but it wont be as chill than those in the above group

| T1                                      | T2          |
| -----------                             | ----------- |
| CPEN 211                                |  MATH 256    |
| CPEN 221                                |  CPEN 212    |
| CPEN 281                                |  CPEN 291    |
| The MATH course that you didn't take    |  ELEC 201    |

\* You would want to take CPSC 221 in the following summer. You could also move 281 into summer too if you really wanted

Likewise, the key is not to have 5 courses in any semester. However, given that you will need to take either 253 or 220, your 1st term is still going to be busy even with 4. I would suggest moving 281 to summer if the course you need to take is 220, as it is much harder than 253. However if its the other way around, then leaving as is may still be doable, though still expect to spend a lot of time on school. Alternatively, you could do a shuffle by moving 281 to summer, moving 256 from t2 to t1, and taking CPSC 221 on time, which is a good idea if you want to co-op right after your second year during that summer.

- *Scenario 3: Nothing done from 2nd year, but everything in 1st year is done*

Oof rip. Though things still won't be bad as you think it will be, you'll just have to move some things into the following summer, and perhaps lose a co-op term:

| T1          | T2          |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| CPEN 211    |  MATH 256    |
| CPEN 221    |  CPEN 212    |
| MATH 220    |  CPEN 291    |
| MATH 253    |  ELEC 201    |

\* Take CPEN 281 as APSC 201 in following summer, as well as CPSC 221.

You will need to do at least 2 courses in summer, which generally precludes you from co-oping. Alternatively, you could move 220 to the summer term, only take 3 courses in t1, and do CPSC 221 in the fall term of year 3, which ended up being similar to what I did. You could also swap 220 and 256 around as 220 is pretty hard, and not a really good pairing with CPEN 221 and 211. If you really want to co-op, then stick to what is on the table, but move CPSC 221 to the 1st term of 3rd year. However, you will want to study up some basic DS&A over the winter break so you can have a easier time with coding interviews required for some jobs.

- *Scenario 4: You are like me*

Oof rip. Time to have no life for an entire year:

This was what I ended up doing. The course I was missing was linear algebra.

| T1          | T2          |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| CPEN 211    |  Mald        |
| CPEN 221    |  MATH 256    |
| CPEN 281    |  CPEN 291    |
| MATH 253    |  ELEC 201    |
| MATH 221    |  CPEN 212    |

\* I took MATH 220 along with 3rd year stats course and a free elective in the summer. Then I did CPSC 221 3rd year.

Looking over this, I would say this isn't the most ideal. I felt really burnt out from taking 5 courses in 1st semester, where 2 of them are notoriously known among the top 10 hardest courses in the university. This forced me tho withdraw MATH 220 from T2 where I was originally going to take it, pushing me back a semester. Instead, if the course you are missing is linear algebra, then this may be better for you.

| T1          | T2          |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| CPEN 211    |  CPEN 212    |
| CPEN 221    |  MATH 256    |
| MATH 253    |  CPEN 291    |
| MATH 221    |  ELEC 201    |

\* Take CPEN 281 as APSC 201 in summer, plus MATH 220. Then try to take a third course in the summer, such as probability/stats, a free elective, or anything that you normally would take in 3rd year. Then, you can move CPSC 221 to 3rd year without overloading your schedule.

You will definitely not want to CO-OP in the summer, since regardless of how you arrange your schedule you will be leaving multiple courses till then. It is important to not overload your schedule to catch up. Avoid fitting 5 courses in any term, and DEFINITELY DO NOT even attempt 6. There is a reason why other eng majors get 7 courses a term where we only get 5 max.
